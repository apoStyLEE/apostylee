Hello, I'm Abdullah Uğraşkan `(apoStyLEE)`

I live in Trabzon, Turkey, and I have three children. I'm a full stack software developer working at **[SiberUzay][07]** Technologies. For a long time, we have been developing SAAS (Multi-Tenancy) applications and products within the .Net (dotnetcore) ecosystem. Additionally, my journey in front-end development started with JavaScript, continued with jQuery and Bootstrap, and now includes modern front-end tools. We also have a community called **[kodla][06]**, where we voluntarily organize events and activities.

I enjoy creating content and sharing what I learn on my **[YouTube][00]** channel. Recently, I have been preparing free tutorials to contribute to the **[VUE][01]** and **[NUXT][02]** ecosystems.
